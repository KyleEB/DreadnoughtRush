Goal: The current mothership is the big orange and blue triangle, once the player hits it a victory message pops up.

Assets: All the assets were hand created by myself, hence why the skybox is terrible, but that's for a latter day to fix.


Time Spent: I kept a journal of how long I worked on the project and what I worked on in the time.

Overall I spent 85 hours on the assignment to reach it's current state.

What is currently done:
Goal Message
Dynamic Steering
Torpedos
Asteroid Generation
Asteroid Special Collisions with torpedo and the player.
